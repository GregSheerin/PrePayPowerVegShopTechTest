The exercise to be carried out consists of setting up a vegetable shop. The store will have a series of 
products.
Each product will have a price. For example:
Tomatoes 0.75€
Aubergines 0.9€
Carrots 1€


You can add offers for each product. Continuing with the previous example:
Buy 3 Aubergines and pay 2.
Get a free Aubergine for every 2 Tomatoes you buy.
For every 4€ spent on Tomatoes, we will deduct one euro from your final invoice.


The input of the application must be:
-A file where the products and prices are specified similar to
PRODUCT,PRICE
Tomato,0.75
Aubergine,0.9
Carrot,1
-A file describing a purchase, of the style
PRODUCT,QUANTITY
Tomato,3
Aubergine,25
Carrot,12
The output must be a receipt with:
The total price, the list of products purchased, the offers applied. It can be in a file or outputted on a 
console.
You have maximum 2 days to perform the exercise from the moment you receive it by mail.
The code files should be placed on the folder (shared link).
Anything to be assumed must be commented on the code or in a readme file.
The programming language should be C#.
We expect you to create Unit tests that will validate the business logic.
The quality, scalability and organisation of the solution will be key aspects during the evaluation 
process.
The quality of the structure will be valued more than the total completeness of the exercise and its 
functionality.
Good luck!
